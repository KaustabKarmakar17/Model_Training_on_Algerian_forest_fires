# Model_Training_on_Algerian_forest_fires
This is a Model implementation on a Dataset collected from Kaggle.

In this Collab file I've Implemented Linear Regression, Lasso Regression alongwith Cross Validation.
Exploratory Data Analysis has also been done.

Main aim is to, "Predict The Temperature using Linear Regression".

Although the accuracy is low, but it may due to Multi-Collinearity within the Features, if this is addressed then we may see improved Accuracy.
